## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js >= 16.x
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Access to supported blockchains (Mainnet & Testnet)
- Native tokens for contract deployment (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC)

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xkid-root/SecureFi-metamask
   cd SecureFi
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your blockchain provider URLs and API keys:
     ```env
     ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
     BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
     POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com/
     ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **Usage**
1. Connect your wallet to the SecureFi dashboard.
2. Select the target blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.).
3. Choose a smart contract template or upload your custom contract.
4. Run an AI-powered security audit.
5. Deploy your contract with one click.
6. Monitor and verify your deployment on the blockchain explorer.
