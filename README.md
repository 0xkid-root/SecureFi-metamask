   ```
3. Configure your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your blockchain provider URLs and API keys:
     ```env
     ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
     BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
     POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com/
     ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
