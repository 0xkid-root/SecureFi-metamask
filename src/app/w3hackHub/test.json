The hacker quickly sold 592 million tokens for $21.8 million in ETH on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and 0xProject, causing the token's price to drop by 20%. Gala Games detected the exploit, activated their blocklist function, which had been implemented a year earlier, and froze the rogue wallet, mitigating further damage. The Ethereum contract for GALA was secure and under the protection of a multi-sig wallet. The company worked with the FBI, DOJ, and international authorities to identify the hacker, who later returned approximately $22 million in ETH to a Gala-controlled wallet. The remaining funds were secured, and Gala Games plans to use the returned ETH to buy back and burn GALA tokens to stabilize the supply. Despite the rapid response, the incident caused significant market disruption, contrasting with the broader market rally following Ethereum ETF approval news. The exploit highlighted critical access control failures and suspicious internal activities, with historical incidents suggesting potential internal sabotage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xe2ca471124b124831e231fb835778840ad100f97</p><p>Mint tx:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa6d90abe17d17743a9cecab84bcefb0fd0bbfa0c61bba60fd2f680b0a2f077fe</p><p>List of sell txs can be found here:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/token/0xd1d2eb1b1e90b638588728b4130137d262c87cae?a=0xe2ca471124b124831e231fb835778840ad100f97</p>",

Within an hour, two addresses withdrew a total of $4.3 million in digital assets, which were transferred to addresses funded by TornadoCash. This attack was enabled through compromised private keys obtained via phishing, allowing the exploiter to drain assets from the XLink bridge. The XLink team paused smart contracts and the bridge in response. The attacker took control of XLink endpoints on BSC and Ethereum, upgrading them to a malicious contract, leading to the withdrawal of ~$4.3 million on BSC, which was later recovered with the help of a whitehat. Another $5 million, mainly LunarCrush tokens, are secured on Ethereum. Approximately $500k remains locked but secured. aBTC assets were unaffected as they are held in a custodian account at Cobo. The XLink team is monitoring the exploiter's wallets and coordinating with security partners to resolve the situation and return to normal operations, assuring the community that all necessary steps are being taken to address the exploit and assist affected users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Exploit Transactions:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x94746d33792aeb27d2066b6d8f3c8a8c7410fe15c9500059f35e0b21c9bfb416</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x47e123af93add709bc2516f6a5db057dfbb1d66a75b693cd7980cd3eb28c7357</p><p>Destination Addresses:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xa747af2a527e72ce303353b458a1c51ebcd53188</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x27055ae433e9dcb30f6ebcc1a374cf5cc03c484e</p><p><br></p>",
